        Hey there, my name is Geoff Miller! I'm a self-proclaimed up and coming portrait, event, and cosplay photographer based in Cleveland, OH. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I've been a cosplayer, personally, since 2008 and took up photography in 2009. I've always loved cosplay and I've
        always loved photography, so mixing the two was an obvious choice for me, especially when I realized that I could help people display and show off their hard work on their costumes as well as how truly happy they are in their element. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I currently shoot with my Canon EOS T6S, and my lenses switch between a few different options depending on the style of
        the shoot.
        <br/>
        <br/> My goal is to make people who book with me, feel happy, to feel like they're going to love the final product- and then be blown away when they get their photos back and are given something ten times better than what they had expected originally.
        When I'm in a shoot, I'm dedicated to making sure the cosplayer, or model, is going to enjoy themselves. Awkward shoots are never my goal and I make sure to give you a unque experience of laughter and silliness incorporated with making sure you look
        your best at the same time.
        <br/>
        <br/> Additionally, as a fun fact, I have three cats, and they're basically my children. Talk to me any time about cats. Please.
